            website developement
        </h1>  
        <p>
        for web development we used HTML and css
        HTML is served as the backbone of the website 
        declaring the website frameworks,content , images , the website dimensions
        language used and links. 
        </p>
        <p>
        CSS is used for editing website layouts and styles like fonts,
        positioning of text , colours and can be used internally or externally
        </p>

            2D & 3D Computer Aided Drafting
        </h1>
        <p>
            for 2d graphics we used 2 different software 
            raster graphics and vector graphics   
        </p>
        <h2>
        Gimp
        </h2>
        <p>
        the first being raster graphics which allows you to edit raster files
        which are pixel based arranged in a matrix to be form images
        files include in the form of Jpeg , Png, GIF.
        for the exercise we used GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)
        to edit the image by using the free select tool 
        then adding a mask layer and turning it invisible to get a image of just the object we want.
        </p>
        <h2>Inkscape</h2>
        <p>
         next was vector graphics which uses mathmatical equations to draw out graphics
        the resultant image is often scaleable without losing quality or looking pixelated unlike raster based graphics
        files include SVG,Pdf,EPS,Dvg.
        </p>
        <h2>Fusion 360</h2>
        <p>for 3d cad drafting we used Fusion 360 a 
            3d cad software that uses parametric modelling techniques 
            defined by user dimensions. we can model in 2d to create 2d drawings
            or 3d drawing objects. 
            it uses the form of sketches to create a basic sketch that can be extruded
            using the extrusion tool.
